## Project: Aura Design System
Aura is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade design system built from the ground up. It provides a reusable library of accessible, theme-aware UI components, all supported by a robust, fully automated testing and deployment pipeline. The system is designed to ensure brand consistency, accelerate development, and enforce the highest quality standards across any web application.

## How This Project Enhances Your Resume
This is a powerful portfolio project because it demonstrates a wide range of highly sought-after skills beyond just "building components." It proves you can own a project from start to finish.

Demonstrates Full-Stack Mentality: You didn't just write UI code; you architected the entire workflow, including testing, versioning, and deployment. This shows a complete understanding of the modern development lifecycle.

Highlights Expertise in Automation (CI/CD): Building the CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions is the most impressive part. It shows you can create a "quality gate" that automatically enforces standards, which is a key skill in any professional software team. You automated:

Accessibility Testing: Guaranteeing 100% compliance with Axe.

Visual Regression Testing: Preventing accidental UI bugs with Chromatic.

Performance Monitoring: Guarding against bundle size bloat.

Showcases In-Demand Technologies: You used a modern, industry-standard tech stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, and Storybook.

Emphasizes Accessibility (A11y) First: You didn't just build components; you built accessible components and, more importantly, proved it with automated tests. This is a critical and often-overlooked skill that sets you apart.

Proves Scalability and Governance: By building a virtualized data grid and creating contribution guidelines, you show that you can think about how a system will perform at scale and be maintained by a team over time.

## How to Explain This Project in an Interview
When an interviewer asks, "Tell me about a project you're proud of," this is your perfect answer. Structure your explanation like this:

### 1. The Elevator Pitch (Start with the "What")
"I recently built a complete design system from the ground up called Aura. Itâ€™s a fully-tested, theme-aware component library, published as an npm package with its own documentation site."

### 2. The Problem You Solved (The "Why")
"The goal was to solve the common problems of UI inconsistency and slow development in a team setting. I wanted to create a single source of truth for UI components that would ensure brand consistency, improve developer velocity, and enforce accessibility standards from the very start."

### 3. Your Actions (The "How" - This is the most important part)
"I built the system using a modern stack: React, TypeScript, and Vite, with Storybook for component development and documentation.

The real core of the project, however, was the CI/CD pipeline I created with GitHub Actions. This pipeline acts as an automated quality gate. On every pull request, it automatically runs three critical checks:

Accessibility tests using Axe, failing the build if any violations are found.

Visual regression tests using Chromatic, which takes screenshots of every component to catch any unintended UI changes.

A bundle size check to prevent the library from becoming slow and bloated.

This means that no code that breaks accessibility, looks wrong, or hurts performance can ever be merged."

### 4. The Results (The "Outcome")
"The final result was a stable, versioned component library published to npm, which can be installed in any project. The documentation is deployed live on Vercel, making it easy for anyone on a team to browse and use the components. The entire system is designed to be not just built, but maintained with a high degree of quality thanks to the automated guards I put in place."
